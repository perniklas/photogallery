# Another photography portfolio gallery thing.

An image gallery for my photography hobby that I don't practice enough. It's meant to be as lightweight as possible, using JavaScript and jQuery to fetch images from an imgur album and then populating a grid with those images.


I wanted to do some more web development as well as make my own gallery, so here we are. The latest version should be live at www.perniklas.no

TODO
* Lightbox
  * Change from hiding lightbox overlay on load to it being hidden by default
  * Figure out why animations aren't functioning
* Grid
  * Add height check for jQuery to not paste all vertical images in one column
  * Remove hover effects on mobile
* Misc
  * Make buttons indicate which images are shown (.css(...) doesn't work)
  * Add info ?
